## Rocket

	Rocket is a 6-stage single-issue in-order pipeline that executes the 64-bit scalar RISC-V ISA. Rocket implements an MMU that supports page-based virtual memory and is able to boot modern operating systems such as Linux. Rocket also has an optional IEEE 754-2008-compliant FPU, which implements both single- and double-precision floating-point operations, including fused multiply-add.
