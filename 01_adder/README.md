# Adders

## 01. Verilog-Adders

	The Aim of this project is to describe and differentiate different types of adders in verilog and distinguish them at simulation level. All adders have been defined for 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit addition along with test benches for each type of adder. This project implements the following adders :

	- Carry Lookahead Adder
	- Carry Ripple Adder
	- Carry Select Adder
	- Carry Skip Adder
	- Kogge Stone Adder
	- Hybrid Adder



## 02. Digital_Adders_Verilog

	32 Bit RippleCarry, CarrySkip, CarrySelect, CarryIncrement, Sklansky, Brent-Kung, Kogge-Stone and CarryLookahead adders with their internal components in Verilog
